         The TRE regular expression implementation (src/regex/reg* and
         src/regex/tre*) is Copyright © 2001-2008 Ville Laurikari and licensed
         under a 2-clause BSD license (license text in the source files). The
         included version has been heavily modified by Rich Felker in 2012, in
         the interests of size, simplicity, and namespace cleanliness.
         
         Much of the math library code (src/math/* and src/complex/*) is

         The ARM memcpy code (src/string/arm/memcpy.S) is Copyright © 2008
         The Android Open Source Project and is licensed under a two-clause BSD
         license. It was taken from Bionic libc, used on Android.
         
         The AArch64 memcpy and memset code (src/string/aarch64/*) are
         Copyright © 1999-2019, Arm Limited.
         
         The implementation of DES for crypt (src/crypt/crypt_des.c) is
         Copyright © 1994 David Burren. It is licensed under a BSD license.
         
         The implementation of blowfish crypt (src/crypt/crypt_blowfish.c) was
         originally written by Solar Designer and placed into the public
         domain. The code also comes with a fallback permissive license for use
         in jurisdictions that may not recognize the public domain.
         
         The smoothsort implementation (src/stdlib/qsort.c) is Copyright © 2011

         The x86_64 port was written by Nicholas J. Kain and is licensed under
         the standard MIT terms.
         
         The mips and microblaze ports were originally written by Richard
         Pennington for use in the ellcc project. The original code was adapted
         by Rich Felker for build system and code conventions during upstream
         integration. It is licensed under the standard MIT terms.
         
         The mips64 port was contributed by Imagination Technologies and is
         licensed under the standard MIT terms.
         
         The powerpc port was also originally written by Richard Pennington,
         and later supplemented and integrated by John Spencer. It is licensed
         under the standard MIT terms.
         
         All other files which have no copyright comments are original works
         produced specifically for use as part of this library, written either
         by Rich Felker, the main author of the library, or by one or more
         contibutors listed above. Details on authorship of individual files
         can be found in the git version control history of the project. The
         omission of copyright and license comments in each file is in the
         interest of source tree size.
         
         In addition, permission is hereby granted for all public header files
         (include/* and arch/*/bits/*) and crt files intended to be linked into
         applications (crt/*, ldso/dlstart.c, and arch/*/crt_arch.h) to omit
         the copyright notice and permission notice otherwise required by the
         license, and to use these files without any requirement of
         attribution. These files include substantial contributions from:

         This file previously contained text expressing a belief that most of
         the files covered by the above exception were sufficiently trivial not
         to be subject to copyright, resulting in confusion over whether it
         negated the permissions granted in the license. In the spirit of
         permissive licensing, and of not having licensing issues being an
         obstacle to adoption, that text has been removed.Copyright (c) 2005-2023, NumPy Developers.

            TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
         
            1. Definitions.
         
               "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
               and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
         
               "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
               the copyright owner that is granting the License.
         
               "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
               other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
               control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
               "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
               direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
               otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
               outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
         
               "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
               exercising permissions granted by this License.
         
               "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
               including but not limited to software source code, documentation
               source, and configuration files.
         
               "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
               transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
               not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
               and conversions to other media types.
         
               "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
               Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
               copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
               (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
         
               "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
               form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
               editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
               represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
               of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
               separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
               the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
         
               "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
               the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
               to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
               submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
               or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
               the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
               means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
               to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
               communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
               and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
               Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
               excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
               designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
         
               "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
               on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
               subsequently incorporated within the Work.
         
            2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
               this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
               publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
               Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
         
            3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
               this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
               use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
               where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
               by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
               Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
               with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
               institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
               cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
               or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
               or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
               granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
               as of the date such litigation is filed.
         
            4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
               Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
               modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
               meet the following conditions:
         
               (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                   Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
         
               (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                   stating that You changed the files; and
         
               (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                   that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                   attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                   excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                   the Derivative Works; and
         
               (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                   distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                   include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                   within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                   pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                   of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                   as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                   documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                   within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                   wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                   of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                   do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                   notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                   or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                   that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                   as modifying the License.
         
               You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
               may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
               for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
               for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
               reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
               the conditions stated in this License.
         
            5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
               any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
               by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
               this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
               Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
               the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
               with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
         
            6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
               names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
               except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
               origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
         
            7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
               agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
               Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
               WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
               implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
               of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
               PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
               appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
               risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
         
            8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
               whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
               unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
               negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
               liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
               incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
               result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
               Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
               work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
               other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
               has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
         
            9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
               the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
               and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
               or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
               License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
               on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
               of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
               defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
               incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
               of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         ==========================
         
         Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
         Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see https://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
         as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
         principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.
         
         In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
         National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see https://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
         in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
         software.
         
         In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
         BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
         year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became
         Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see
         https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization
         created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.
         Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.
         
         All Python releases are Open Source (see https://opensource.org for
         the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
         releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
         the various releases.

             1.6.1           1.6         2001        CNRI        yes (2)
             2.1             2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         no
             2.0.1           2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         yes
             2.1.1           2.1+2.0.1   2001        PSF         yes
             2.1.2           2.1.1       2002        PSF         yes
             2.1.3           2.1.2       2002        PSF         yes
             2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes
         
         Footnotes:
         
         (1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
             the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
             a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
             GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
             other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.
         
         (2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
             because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
             CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
             is "not incompatible" with the GPL.
         
         Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
         direction to make these releases possible.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
         
         1. Definitions.
         
         "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and
         distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
         
         "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by the copyright
         owner that is granting the License.
         
         "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all other entities
         that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity.
         For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or
         indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by
         contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
         outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
         
         "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising
         permissions granted by this License.
         
         "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, including

         files.
         
         "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or
         translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code,
         generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.
         
         "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made
         available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included
         in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
         
         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that
         is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions,
         annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an
         original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works
         shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by
         name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
         
         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version
         of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works
         thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work
         by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit
         on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition,
         "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
         to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
         communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and
         issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for
         the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication
         that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright
         owner as "Not a Contribution."
         
         "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf
         of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently
         incorporated within the Work.
         
         2. Grant of Copyright License.
         
         Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby
         grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
         irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such
         Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
         
         3. Grant of Patent License.
         
         Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby
         grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
         irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have
         made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where
         such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor
         that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination
         of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
         submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a
         Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory
         patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License
         for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
         
         4. Redistribution.
         
         You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof
         in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form,
         provided that You meet the following conditions:
         
         You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of
         this License; and
         You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You
         changed the files; and
         You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute,
         all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form
         of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the
         Derivative Works; and
         If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any
         Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the
         attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices
         that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the
         following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the
         Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along
         with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative
         Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of
         the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
         License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that
         You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work,
         provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as
         modifying the License.
         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
         additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
         distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
         provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
         with the conditions stated in this License.
         
         5. Submission of Contributions.
         
         Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted
         for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and
         conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of
         any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding
         such Contributions.
         
         6. Trademarks.
         
         This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,
         service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for
         reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
         reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
         
         7. Disclaimer of Warranty.
         
         Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the
         Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied,
         including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE,
         NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are
         solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or
         redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of
         permissions under this License.
         
         8. Limitation of Liability.
         
         In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence),
         contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
         and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental,
         or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or
         out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to
         damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or
         any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has
         been advised of the possibility of such damages.
         
         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.
         
         While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to
         offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or
         other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However,
         in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your
         sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You
         agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your
         accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
         
         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
         
         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work
         
         To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following boilerplate
         notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]" replaced with your own
         identifying information. (Don't include the brackets!) The text should be
         enclosed in the appropriate comment syntax for the file format. We also
         recommend that a file or class name and description of purpose be included on
         the same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier identification within
         third-party archives.

         The implementation of blowfish crypt (src/crypt/crypt_blowfish.c) was
         originally written by Solar Designer and placed into the public
         domain. The code also comes with a fallback permissive license for use
         in jurisdictions that may not recognize the public domain.

         The mips and microblaze ports were originally written by Richard
         Pennington for use in the ellcc project. The original code was adapted
         by Rich Felker for build system and code conventions during upstream
         integration. It is licensed under the standard MIT terms.
         
         The mips64 port was contributed by Imagination Technologies and is

         The powerpc port was also originally written by Richard Pennington,
         and later supplemented and integrated by John Spencer. It is licensed
         under the standard MIT terms.
         
         All other files which have no copyright comments are original works
         produced specifically for use as part of this library, written either
         by Rich Felker, the main author of the library, or by one or more
         contibutors listed above. Details on authorship of individual files
         can be found in the git version control history of the project. The
         omission of copyright and license comments in each file is in the
         interest of source tree size.
         
         In addition, permission is hereby granted for all public header files

         This file previously contained text expressing a belief that most of
         the files covered by the above exception were sufficiently trivial not
         to be subject to copyright, resulting in confusion over whether it
         negated the permissions granted in the license. In the spirit of
         permissive licensing, and of not having licensing issues being an
         obstacle to adoption, that text has been removed.Copyright (c) 2005-2023, NumPy Developers.

            TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
         
            1. Definitions.

               "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
               the copyright owner that is granting the License.
         
               "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
               other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
               control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
               "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
               direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
               otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
               outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
         
               "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
               exercising permissions granted by this License.
         
               "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
               including but not limited to software source code, documentation
               source, and configuration files.
         
               "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
               transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
               not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
               and conversions to other media types.
         
               "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
               Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
               copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
               (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
         
               "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
               form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
               editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
               represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
               of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
               separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
               the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
         
               "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
               the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
               to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

               or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
               the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
               means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
               to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to

               and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
               Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
               excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise

               "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
               on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
               subsequently incorporated within the Work.
         
            2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
               this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
               publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
               Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
         
            3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
               this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
               use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
               where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
               by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
               Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
               with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
               institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
               cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
               or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
               or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
               granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
               as of the date such litigation is filed.
         
            4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
               Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
               modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
               meet the following conditions:
         
               (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                   Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
         
               (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                   stating that You changed the files; and
         
               (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                   that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                   attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                   excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                   the Derivative Works; and
         
               (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                   distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                   include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                   within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                   pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                   of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                   as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                   documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                   within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                   wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                   of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                   do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                   notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                   or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                   that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                   as modifying the License.
         
               You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
               may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
               for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
               for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
               reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
               the conditions stated in this License.
         
            5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
               any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
               by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
               this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
               Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
               the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
               with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
         
            6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
               names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
               except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
               origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
         
            7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
               agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
               Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
               WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
               implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
               of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
               PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
               appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
               risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
         
            8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
               whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
               unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
               negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
               liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
               incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
               result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
               Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
               work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
               other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
               has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
         
            9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
               the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
               and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
               or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
               License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
               on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
               of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
               defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
               incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
               of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
         
            END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

         ==========================
         
         Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
         Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see https://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
         as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
         principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.
         
         In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
         National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see https://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
         in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
         software.
         
         In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
         BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
         year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became
         Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see
         https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization
         created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.
         Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.
         
         All Python releases are Open Source (see https://opensource.org for
         the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
         releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
         the various releases.

         Footnotes:
         
         (1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
             the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
             a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
             GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
             other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.
         
         (2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
             because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
             CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
             is "not incompatible" with the GPL.
         
         Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
         direction to make these releases possible.

         7. This License Agreement shall be governed by the federal
         intellectual property law of the United States, including without
         limitation the federal copyright law, and, to the extent such
         U.S. federal law does not apply, by the law of the Commonwealth of
         Virginia, excluding Virginia's conflict of law provisions.
         Notwithstanding the foregoing, with regard to derivative works based
         on Python 1.6.1 that incorporate non-separable material that was
         previously distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), the
         law of the Commonwealth of Virginia shall govern this License
         Agreement only as to issues arising under or with respect to
         Paragraphs 4, 5, and 7 of this License Agreement.  Nothing in this
         License Agreement shall be deemed to create any relationship of
         agency, partnership, or joint venture between CNRI and Licensee.  This
         License Agreement does not grant permission to use CNRI trademarks or
         trade name in a trademark sense to endorse or promote products or
         services of Licensee, or any third party.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
         
         1. Definitions.
         
         "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and
         distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
         
         "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by the copyright

         For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or
         indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by
         contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
         outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
         
         "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising

         files.
         
         "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or
         translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code,
         generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.
         
         "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made
         available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included
         in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
         
         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that
         is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions,
         annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an
         original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works
         shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by
         name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
         
         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version
         of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works
         thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work
         by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit
         on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition,
         "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
         to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
         communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and
         issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for
         the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication
         that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright
         owner as "Not a Contribution."
         
         "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf
         of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently
         incorporated within the Work.
         
         2. Grant of Copyright License.
         
         Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby
         grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
         irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such
         Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
         
         3. Grant of Patent License.
         
         Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby
         grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
         irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have
         made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where
         such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor
         that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination
         of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
         submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a
         Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory
         patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License
         for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
         
         4. Redistribution.
         
         You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof
         in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form,
         provided that You meet the following conditions:
         
         You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of
         this License; and
         You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You
         changed the files; and
         You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute,
         all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form
         of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the
         Derivative Works; and
         If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any
         Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the
         attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices
         that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the
         following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the
         Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along
         with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative
         Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of
         the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
         License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that
         You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work,
         provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as
         modifying the License.
         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
         additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
         distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
         provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
         with the conditions stated in this License.
         
         5. Submission of Contributions.
         
         Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted
         for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and
         conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of
         any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding
         such Contributions.
         
         6. Trademarks.
         
         This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,
         service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for
         reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
         reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
         
         7. Disclaimer of Warranty.
         
         Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the
         Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied,
         including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE,
         NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are
         solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or
         redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of
         permissions under this License.
         
         8. Limitation of Liability.
         
         In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence),
         contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
         and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental,
         or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or
         out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to
         damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or
         any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has
         been advised of the possibility of such damages.
         
         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.
         
         While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to
         offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or
         other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However,
         in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your
         sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You
         agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your
         accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
         
         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
         
         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work
         
         To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following boilerplate
         notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]" replaced with your own
         identifying information. (Don't include the brackets!) The text should be
         enclosed in the appropriate comment syntax for the file format. We also
         recommend that a file or class name and description of purpose be included on
         the same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier identification within
         third-party archives.

         Portions of this software are derived from third-party works licensed
         under terms compatible with the above MIT license:
         
         The TRE regular expression implementation (src/regex/reg* and
         src/regex/tre*) is Copyright © 2001-2008 Ville Laurikari and licensed
         under a 2-clause BSD license (license text in the source files). The
         included version has been heavily modified by Rich Felker in 2012, in
         the interests of size, simplicity, and namespace cleanliness.
         
         Much of the math library code (src/math/* and src/complex/*) is
         Copyright © 1993,2004 Sun Microsystems or
         Copyright © 2003-2011 David Schultz or
         Copyright © 2003-2009 Steven G. Kargl or
         Copyright © 2003-2009 Bruce D. Evans or
         Copyright © 2008 Stephen L. Moshier or
         Copyright © 2017-2018 Arm Limited
         and labelled as such in comments in the individual source files. All
         have been licensed under extremely permissive terms.
         
         The ARM memcpy code (src/string/arm/memcpy.S) is Copyright © 2008
         The Android Open Source Project and is licensed under a two-clause BSD
         license. It was taken from Bionic libc, used on Android.
         
         The AArch64 memcpy and memset code (src/string/aarch64/*) are
         Copyright © 1999-2019, Arm Limited.
         
         The implementation of DES for crypt (src/crypt/crypt_des.c) is
         Copyright © 1994 David Burren. It is licensed under a BSD license.
         
         The implementation of blowfish crypt (src/crypt/crypt_blowfish.c) was
         originally written by Solar Designer and placed into the public
         domain. The code also comes with a fallback permissive license for use
         in jurisdictions that may not recognize the public domain.
         
         The smoothsort implementation (src/stdlib/qsort.c) is Copyright © 2011
         Valentin Ochs and is licensed under an MIT-style license.
         
         The x86_64 port was written by Nicholas J. Kain and is licensed under
         the standard MIT terms.
         
         The mips and microblaze ports were originally written by Richard
         Pennington for use in the ellcc project. The original code was adapted
         by Rich Felker for build system and code conventions during upstream
         integration. It is licensed under the standard MIT terms.
         
         The mips64 port was contributed by Imagination Technologies and is
         licensed under the standard MIT terms.
         
         The powerpc port was also originally written by Richard Pennington,
         and later supplemented and integrated by John Spencer. It is licensed
         under the standard MIT terms.
         
         All other files which have no copyright comments are original works
         produced specifically for use as part of this library, written either
         by Rich Felker, the main author of the library, or by one or more
         contibutors listed above. Details on authorship of individual files
         can be found in the git version control history of the project. The
         omission of copyright and license comments in each file is in the
         interest of source tree size.
         
         In addition, permission is hereby granted for all public header files
         (include/* and arch/*/bits/*) and crt files intended to be linked into
         applications (crt/*, ldso/dlstart.c, and arch/*/crt_arch.h) to omit
         the copyright notice and permission notice otherwise required by the
         license, and to use these files without any requirement of
         attribution. These files include substantial contributions from:
         
         Bobby Bingham
         John Spencer
         Nicholas J. Kain
         Rich Felker
         Richard Pennington
         Stefan Kristiansson
         Szabolcs Nagy
         
         all of whom have explicitly granted such permission.
         
         This file previously contained text expressing a belief that most of
         the files covered by the above exception were sufficiently trivial not
         to be subject to copyright, resulting in confusion over whether it
         negated the permissions granted in the license. In the spirit of
         permissive licensing, and of not having licensing issues being an
         obstacle to adoption, that text has been removed.Copyright (c) 2005-2023, NumPy Developers.

               "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
               the copyright owner that is granting the License.
         
               "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
               other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
               control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
               "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the

               including but not limited to software source code, documentation
               source, and configuration files.
         
               "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical

               "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
               Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
               copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
               (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
         
               "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
               form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
               editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
               represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
               of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
               separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
               the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
         
               "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
               the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

               or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
               the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
               means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
               to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
               communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
               and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
               Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
               excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise

               "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
               on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
               subsequently incorporated within the Work.
         
            2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
               this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
               publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
               Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
         
            3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
               this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
               use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
               where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
               by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
               Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
               with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
               institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
               cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
               or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
               or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
               granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
               as of the date such litigation is filed.
         
            4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
               Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
               modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
               meet the following conditions:
         
               (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or

               this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
               Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
               the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
               with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
         
            6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
               names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
               except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the

               WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
               implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
               of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
               PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the

               risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
         
            8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
               whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
               unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
               negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
               liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
               incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
               result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
               Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
               work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
               other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
               has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
         
            9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
               the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

               or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
               License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
               on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
               of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
               defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
               incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
               of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         ==========================
         
         Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
         Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see https://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
         as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
         principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.
         
         In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
         National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see https://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
         in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
         software.
         
         In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
         BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
         year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became
         Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see
         https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization
         created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.
         Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.
         
         All Python releases are Open Source (see https://opensource.org for
         the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
         releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
         the various releases.
         
             Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-
                             from                                compatible? (1)
         
             0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes
             1.3 thru 1.5.2  1.2         1995-1999   CNRI        yes
             1.6             1.5.2       2000        CNRI        no
             2.0             1.6         2000        BeOpen.com  no
             1.6.1           1.6         2001        CNRI        yes (2)

             2.0.1           2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         yes
             2.1.1           2.1+2.0.1   2001        PSF         yes
             2.1.2           2.1.1       2002        PSF         yes
             2.1.3           2.1.2       2002        PSF         yes
             2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes
         
         Footnotes:
         
         (1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
             the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
             a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
             GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
             other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.
         
         (2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
             because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
             CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
             is "not incompatible" with the GPL.
         
         Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
         direction to make these releases possible.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
         
         1. Definitions.
         
         "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and
         distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
         
         "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by the copyright
         owner that is granting the License.

         that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity.
         For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or
         indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by
         contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
         outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
         
         "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising

         files.
         
         "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or
         translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code,
         generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.
         
         "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made
         available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included
         in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
         
         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that
         is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions,
         annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an
         original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works
         shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by
         name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
         
         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version
         of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works
         thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work
         by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit
         on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition,
         "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
         to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
         communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and
         issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for
         the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication
         that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright
         owner as "Not a Contribution."
         
         "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf
         of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently
         incorporated within the Work.
         
         2. Grant of Copyright License.
         
         Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby
         grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
         irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such
         Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
         
         3. Grant of Patent License.
         
         Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby
         grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
         irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have
         made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where
         such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor
         that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination
         of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
         submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a
         Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory
         patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License
         for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
         
         4. Redistribution.
         
         You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof
         in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form,
         provided that You meet the following conditions:
         
         You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of
         this License; and
         You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You
         changed the files; and
         You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute,
         all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form
         of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the
         Derivative Works; and
         If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any
         Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the
         attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices
         that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the
         following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the
         Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along
         with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative
         Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of
         the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
         License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that
         You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work,
         provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as
         modifying the License.
         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
         additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
         distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
         provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
         with the conditions stated in this License.
         
         5. Submission of Contributions.
         
         Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted
         for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and
         conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of
         any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding
         such Contributions.
         
         6. Trademarks.
         
         This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,
         service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for
         reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
         reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
         
         7. Disclaimer of Warranty.
         
         Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the
         Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied,
         including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE,
         NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are
         solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or
         redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of
         permissions under this License.
         
         8. Limitation of Liability.
         
         In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence),
         contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
         and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental,
         or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or
         out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to
         damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or
         any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has
         been advised of the possibility of such damages.
         
         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.
         
         While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to
         offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or
         other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However,

         Portions of this software are derived from third-party works licensed
         under terms compatible with the above MIT license:
         
         The TRE regular expression implementation (src/regex/reg* and
         src/regex/tre*) is Copyright © 2001-2008 Ville Laurikari and licensed
         under a 2-clause BSD license (license text in the source files). The
         included version has been heavily modified by Rich Felker in 2012, in
         the interests of size, simplicity, and namespace cleanliness.
         
         Much of the math library code (src/math/* and src/complex/*) is
         Copyright © 1993,2004 Sun Microsystems or
         Copyright © 2003-2011 David Schultz or
         Copyright © 2003-2009 Steven G. Kargl or
         Copyright © 2003-2009 Bruce D. Evans or
         Copyright © 2008 Stephen L. Moshier or
         Copyright © 2017-2018 Arm Limited
         and labelled as such in comments in the individual source files. All
         have been licensed under extremely permissive terms.
         
         The ARM memcpy code (src/string/arm/memcpy.S) is Copyright © 2008
         The Android Open Source Project and is licensed under a two-clause BSD
         license. It was taken from Bionic libc, used on Android.
         
         The AArch64 memcpy and memset code (src/string/aarch64/*) are
         Copyright © 1999-2019, Arm Limited.
         
         The implementation of DES for crypt (src/crypt/crypt_des.c) is
         Copyright © 1994 David Burren. It is licensed under a BSD license.
         
         The implementation of blowfish crypt (src/crypt/crypt_blowfish.c) was
         originally written by Solar Designer and placed into the public
         domain. The code also comes with a fallback permissive license for use
         in jurisdictions that may not recognize the public domain.
         
         The smoothsort implementation (src/stdlib/qsort.c) is Copyright © 2011
         Valentin Ochs and is licensed under an MIT-style license.
         
         The x86_64 port was written by Nicholas J. Kain and is licensed under
         the standard MIT terms.
         
         The mips and microblaze ports were originally written by Richard
         Pennington for use in the ellcc project. The original code was adapted
         by Rich Felker for build system and code conventions during upstream
         integration. It is licensed under the standard MIT terms.
         
         The mips64 port was contributed by Imagination Technologies and is
         licensed under the standard MIT terms.
         
         The powerpc port was also originally written by Richard Pennington,
         and later supplemented and integrated by John Spencer. It is licensed
         under the standard MIT terms.
         
         All other files which have no copyright comments are original works
         produced specifically for use as part of this library, written either
         by Rich Felker, the main author of the library, or by one or more
         contibutors listed above. Details on authorship of individual files
         can be found in the git version control history of the project. The
         omission of copyright and license comments in each file is in the
         interest of source tree size.
         
         In addition, permission is hereby granted for all public header files
         (include/* and arch/*/bits/*) and crt files intended to be linked into
         applications (crt/*, ldso/dlstart.c, and arch/*/crt_arch.h) to omit
         the copyright notice and permission notice otherwise required by the
         license, and to use these files without any requirement of
         attribution. These files include substantial contributions from:
         
         Bobby Bingham
         John Spencer
         Nicholas J. Kain
         Rich Felker
         Richard Pennington
         Stefan Kristiansson
         Szabolcs Nagy
         
         all of whom have explicitly granted such permission.
         
         This file previously contained text expressing a belief that most of
         the files covered by the above exception were sufficiently trivial not
         to be subject to copyright, resulting in confusion over whether it
         negated the permissions granted in the license. In the spirit of
         permissive licensing, and of not having licensing issues being an
         obstacle to adoption, that text has been removed.Copyright (c) 2005-2023, NumPy Developers.

               and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
         
               "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
               the copyright owner that is granting the License.
         
               "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
               other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
               control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
               "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the

               including but not limited to software source code, documentation
               source, and configuration files.
         
               "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical

               "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
               Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
               copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
               (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
         
               "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
               form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
               editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
               represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
               of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
               separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
               the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
         
               "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
               the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

               or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
               the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
               means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
               to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
               communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
               and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
               Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
               excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
               designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
         
               "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
               on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
               subsequently incorporated within the Work.
         
            2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
               this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
               publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
               Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
         
            3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
               this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
               use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
               where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
               by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
               Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
               with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
               institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
               cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
               or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
               or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
               granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
               as of the date such litigation is filed.
         
            4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
               Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
               modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
               meet the following conditions:
         
               (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                   Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
         
               (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                   stating that You changed the files; and
         
               (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                   that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                   attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                   excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                   the Derivative Works; and
         
               (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                   distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                   include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                   within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                   pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                   of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                   as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                   documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                   within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                   wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                   of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                   do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                   notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                   or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                   that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                   as modifying the License.

         ==========================
         
         Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
         Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see https://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
         as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
         principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.
         
         In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
         National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see https://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
         in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
         software.
         
         In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
         BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
         year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became
         Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see
         https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization
         created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.
         Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.
         
         All Python releases are Open Source (see https://opensource.org for
         the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
         releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
         the various releases.
         
             Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-
                             from                                compatible? (1)
         
             0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes
             1.3 thru 1.5.2  1.2         1995-1999   CNRI        yes
             1.6             1.5.2       2000        CNRI        no

             1.6.1           1.6         2001        CNRI        yes (2)

             2.0.1           2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         yes
             2.1.1           2.1+2.0.1   2001        PSF         yes
             2.1.2           2.1.1       2002        PSF         yes
             2.1.3           2.1.2       2002        PSF         yes
             2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes
         
         Footnotes:
         
         (1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
             the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
             a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
             GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
             other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.
         
         (2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
             because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
             CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
             is "not incompatible" with the GPL.
         
         Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
         direction to make these releases possible.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
         
         1. Definitions.
         
         "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and
         distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
         
         "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by the copyright
         owner that is granting the License.
         
         "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all other entities
         that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity.
         For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or
         indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by
         contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
         outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
         
         "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising
         permissions granted by this License.
         
         "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, including

         files.
         
         "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or
         translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code,
         generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.
         
         "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made
         available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included
         in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
         
         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that
         is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions,
         annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an
         original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works
         shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by
         name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
         
         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version
         of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works
         thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work
         by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit
         on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition,
         "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
         to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
         communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and
         issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for
         the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication
         that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright
         owner as "Not a Contribution."
         
         "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf
         of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently
         incorporated within the Work.
         
         2. Grant of Copyright License.
         
         Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby
         grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
         irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such
         Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
         
         3. Grant of Patent License.
         
         Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby
         grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
         irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have
         made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where
         such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor
         that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination
         of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
         submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a
         Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory
         patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License
         for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
         
         4. Redistribution.
         
         You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof
         in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form,
         provided that You meet the following conditions:
         
         You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of
         this License; and
         You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You
         changed the files; and
         You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute,
         all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form
         of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the
         Derivative Works; and
         If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any
         Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the
         attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices
         that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the
         following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the
         Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along
         with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative
         Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of
         the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
         License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that
         You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work,
         provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as
         modifying the License.
         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
         additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
         distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
         provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
         with the conditions stated in this License.
         
         5. Submission of Contributions.
         
         Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted
         for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and
         conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of
         any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding
         such Contributions.
         
         6. Trademarks.
         
         This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,
         service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for
         reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
         reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
         
         7. Disclaimer of Warranty.
         
         Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the
         Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied,
         including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE,
         NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are
         solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or
         redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of
         permissions under this License.
         
         8. Limitation of Liability.
         
         In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence),
         contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
         and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental,
         or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or
         out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to
         damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or
         any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has
         been advised of the possibility of such damages.
         
         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.
         
         While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to
         offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or
         other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However,
         in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your
         sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You
         agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your
         accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
         
         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
         
         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work
         
         To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following boilerplate

         Portions of this software are derived from third-party works licensed
         under terms compatible with the above MIT license:
         
         The TRE regular expression implementation (src/regex/reg* and
         src/regex/tre*) is Copyright © 2001-2008 Ville Laurikari and licensed
         under a 2-clause BSD license (license text in the source files). The
         included version has been heavily modified by Rich Felker in 2012, in
         the interests of size, simplicity, and namespace cleanliness.
         
         Much of the math library code (src/math/* and src/complex/*) is
         Copyright © 1993,2004 Sun Microsystems or
         Copyright © 2003-2011 David Schultz or
         Copyright © 2003-2009 Steven G. Kargl or
         Copyright © 2003-2009 Bruce D. Evans or
         Copyright © 2008 Stephen L. Moshier or
         Copyright © 2017-2018 Arm Limited
         and labelled as such in comments in the individual source files. All
         have been licensed under extremely permissive terms.
         
         The ARM memcpy code (src/string/arm/memcpy.S) is Copyright © 2008
         The Android Open Source Project and is licensed under a two-clause BSD
         license. It was taken from Bionic libc, used on Android.
         
         The AArch64 memcpy and memset code (src/string/aarch64/*) are
         Copyright © 1999-2019, Arm Limited.
         
         The implementation of DES for crypt (src/crypt/crypt_des.c) is
         Copyright © 1994 David Burren. It is licensed under a BSD license.
         
         The implementation of blowfish crypt (src/crypt/crypt_blowfish.c) was
         originally written by Solar Designer and placed into the public
         domain. The code also comes with a fallback permissive license for use
         in jurisdictions that may not recognize the public domain.
         
         The smoothsort implementation (src/stdlib/qsort.c) is Copyright © 2011
         Valentin Ochs and is licensed under an MIT-style license.
         
         The x86_64 port was written by Nicholas J. Kain and is licensed under
         the standard MIT terms.
         
         The mips and microblaze ports were originally written by Richard
         Pennington for use in the ellcc project. The original code was adapted
         by Rich Felker for build system and code conventions during upstream
         integration. It is licensed under the standard MIT terms.
         
         The mips64 port was contributed by Imagination Technologies and is
         licensed under the standard MIT terms.
         
         The powerpc port was also originally written by Richard Pennington,
         and later supplemented and integrated by John Spencer. It is licensed
         under the standard MIT terms.
         
         All other files which have no copyright comments are original works
         produced specifically for use as part of this library, written either
         by Rich Felker, the main author of the library, or by one or more
         contibutors listed above. Details on authorship of individual files
         can be found in the git version control history of the project. The
         omission of copyright and license comments in each file is in the
         interest of source tree size.
         
         In addition, permission is hereby granted for all public header files
         (include/* and arch/*/bits/*) and crt files intended to be linked into
         applications (crt/*, ldso/dlstart.c, and arch/*/crt_arch.h) to omit
         the copyright notice and permission notice otherwise required by the
         license, and to use these files without any requirement of
         attribution. These files include substantial contributions from:
         
         Bobby Bingham
         John Spencer
         Nicholas J. Kain
         Rich Felker
         Richard Pennington
         Stefan Kristiansson
         Szabolcs Nagy
         
         all of whom have explicitly granted such permission.
         
         This file previously contained text expressing a belief that most of
         the files covered by the above exception were sufficiently trivial not
         to be subject to copyright, resulting in confusion over whether it
         negated the permissions granted in the license. In the spirit of
         permissive licensing, and of not having licensing issues being an
         obstacle to adoption, that text has been removed.Copyright (c) 2005-2023, NumPy Developers.

            TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
         
            1. Definitions.

               "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
               the copyright owner that is granting the License.
         
               "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
               other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
               control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
               "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the

               including but not limited to software source code, documentation
               source, and configuration files.
         
               "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical

               "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
               Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
               copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
               (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
         
               "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
               form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
               editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
               represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
               of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
               separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
               the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
         
               "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
               the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

               or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
               the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
               means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
               to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
               communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
               and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
               Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
               excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
               designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
         
               "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
               on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
               subsequently incorporated within the Work.
         
            2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
               this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
               publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
               Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
         
            3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
               this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
               use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
               where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
               by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
               Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
               with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
               institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
               cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
               or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
               or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
               granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
               as of the date such litigation is filed.
         
            4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
               Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
               modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
               meet the following conditions:
         
               (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                   Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
         
               (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                   stating that You changed the files; and
         
               (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                   that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                   attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,

               the conditions stated in this License.
         
            5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
               any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work

               this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
               Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
               the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
               with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
         
            6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
               names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
               except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
               origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
         
            7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or

               Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
               WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
               implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
               of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
               PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the

               risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
         
            8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
               whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
               unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
               negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
               liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
               incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
               result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
               Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
               work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
               other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
               has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
         
            9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
               the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
               and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
               or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
               License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
               on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
               of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
               defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
               incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
               of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         ==========================
         
         Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
         Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see https://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
         as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
         principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.
         
         In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
         National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see https://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
         in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
         software.
         
         In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
         BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
         year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became
         Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see
         https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization
         created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.
         Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.
         
         All Python releases are Open Source (see https://opensource.org for
         the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
         releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
         the various releases.
         
             Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-
                             from                                compatible? (1)
         
             0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes
             1.3 thru 1.5.2  1.2         1995-1999   CNRI        yes

             1.6.1           1.6         2001        CNRI        yes (2)

             2.0.1           2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         yes
             2.1.1           2.1+2.0.1   2001        PSF         yes
             2.1.2           2.1.1       2002        PSF         yes
             2.1.3           2.1.2       2002        PSF         yes
             2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes
         
         Footnotes:
         
         (1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
             the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
             a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
             GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
             other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.
         
         (2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
             because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
             CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
             is "not incompatible" with the GPL.
         
         Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
         direction to make these releases possible.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
         
         1. Definitions.
         
         "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and
         distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
         
         "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by the copyright
         owner that is granting the License.
         
         "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all other entities
         that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity.
         For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or
         indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by
         contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
         outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
         
         "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising
         permissions granted by this License.

         files.
         
         "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or
         translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code,
         generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.
         
         "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made
         available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included
         in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
         
         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that
         is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions,
         annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an
         original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works
         shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by
         name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
         
         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version
         of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works
         thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work
         by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit
         on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition,
         "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
         to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
         communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and
         issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for
         the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication
         that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright
         owner as "Not a Contribution."
         
         "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf
         of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently
         incorporated within the Work.
         
         2. Grant of Copyright License.
         
         Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby
         grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
         irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such
         Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
         
         3. Grant of Patent License.
         
         Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby
         grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
         irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have
         made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where
         such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor
         that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination
         of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
         submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a
         Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory
         patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License
         for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
         
         4. Redistribution.
         
         You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof
         in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form,
         provided that You meet the following conditions:
         
         You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of
         this License; and
         You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You
         changed the files; and
         You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute,
         all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form
         of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the
         Derivative Works; and
         If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any
         Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the
         attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices
         that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the
         following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the
         Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along
         with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative
         Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of
         the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
         License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that
         You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work,
         provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as
         modifying the License.
         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
         additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
         distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
         provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
         with the conditions stated in this License.
         
         5. Submission of Contributions.
         
         Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted
         for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and
         conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of
         any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding
         such Contributions.
         
         6. Trademarks.
         
         This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,
         service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for
         reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
         reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
         
         7. Disclaimer of Warranty.
         
         Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the
         Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied,
         including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE,
         NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are
         solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or
         redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of
         permissions under this License.
         
         8. Limitation of Liability.
         
         In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence),
         contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
         and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental,
         or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or
         out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to
         damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or
         any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has
         been advised of the possibility of such damages.
         
         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.
         
         While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to
         offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or
         other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However,
         in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your
         sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You
         agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your
         accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
         
            1. Definitions.

               and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
         
               "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
               the copyright owner that is granting the License.
         
               "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
               other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
               control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
               "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
               direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
               otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
               outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
         
               "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
               exercising permissions granted by this License.
         
               "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
               including but not limited to software source code, documentation
               source, and configuration files.
         
               "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
               transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
               not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
               and conversions to other media types.
         
               "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
               Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
               copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
               (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
         
               "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
               form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
               editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
               represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
               of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
               separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
               the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
         
               "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
               the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
               to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

               or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
               the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
               means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
               to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
               communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
               and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
               Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
               excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
               designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
         
               "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
               on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
               subsequently incorporated within the Work.
         
            2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
               this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
               publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
               Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
         
            3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
               this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
               use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
               where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
               by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
               Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
               with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
               institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
               cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
               or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
               or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
               granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
               as of the date such litigation is filed.
         
            4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
               Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
               modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
               meet the following conditions:
         
               (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                   Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
         
               (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                   stating that You changed the files; and
         
               (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                   that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                   attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                   excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                   the Derivative Works; and
         
               (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                   distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                   include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                   within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                   pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                   of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                   as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                   documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                   within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                   wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                   of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                   do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                   notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                   or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                   that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                   as modifying the License.
         
               You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
               may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
               for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
               for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
               reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
               the conditions stated in this License.
         
            5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
               any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
               by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
               this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
               Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
               the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
               with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
         
            6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
               names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
               except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
               origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
         
            7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
               agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
               Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
               WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
               implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
               of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
               PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
               appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
               risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
         
            8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
               whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
               unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
               negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
               liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
               incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
               result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
               Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
               work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
               other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
               has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
         
            9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
               the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
               and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
               or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
               License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
               on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
               of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
               defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
               incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
               of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
         
            END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

         ==========================
         
         Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
         Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see https://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
         as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
         principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.
         
         In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
         National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see https://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
         in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
         software.
         
         In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
         BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
         year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became
         Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see
         https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization
         created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.
         Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.
         
         All Python releases are Open Source (see https://opensource.org for
         the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
         releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
         the various releases.

         Footnotes:
         
         (1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
             the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
             a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
             GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
             other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.
         
         (2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
             because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
             CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
             is "not incompatible" with the GPL.
         
         Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
         direction to make these releases possible.

         7. This License Agreement shall be governed by the federal
         intellectual property law of the United States, including without
         limitation the federal copyright law, and, to the extent such
         U.S. federal law does not apply, by the law of the Commonwealth of
         Virginia, excluding Virginia's conflict of law provisions.
         Notwithstanding the foregoing, with regard to derivative works based
         on Python 1.6.1 that incorporate non-separable material that was
         previously distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), the
         law of the Commonwealth of Virginia shall govern this License
         Agreement only as to issues arising under or with respect to
         Paragraphs 4, 5, and 7 of this License Agreement.  Nothing in this
         License Agreement shall be deemed to create any relationship of
         agency, partnership, or joint venture between CNRI and Licensee.  This
         License Agreement does not grant permission to use CNRI trademarks or
         trade name in a trademark sense to endorse or promote products or

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
         
         1. Definitions.
         
         "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and

         For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or
         indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by
         contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
         outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
         
         "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising

         files.
         
         "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or
         translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code,
         generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.
         
         "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made
         available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included
         in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
         
         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that
         is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions,
         annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an
         original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works
         shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by
         name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
         
         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version
         of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works
         thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work
         by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit
         on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition,
         "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
         to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
         communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and
         issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for
         the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication
         that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright
         owner as "Not a Contribution."
         
         "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf
         of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently
         incorporated within the Work.
         
         2. Grant of Copyright License.
         
         Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby
         grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
         irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such
         Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
         
         3. Grant of Patent License.
         
         Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby
         grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
         irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have
         made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where
         such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor
         that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination
         of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
         submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a
         Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory
         patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License
         for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
         
         4. Redistribution.
         
         You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof
         in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form,
         provided that You meet the following conditions:
         
         You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of
         this License; and
         You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You
         changed the files; and
         You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute,
         all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form
         of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the
         Derivative Works; and
         If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any
         Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the
         attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices
         that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the
         following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the
         Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along
         with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative
         Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of
         the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
         License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that
         You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work,
         provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as
         modifying the License.
         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
         additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
         distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
         provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
         with the conditions stated in this License.
         
         5. Submission of Contributions.
         
         Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted
         for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and
         conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of
         any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding
         such Contributions.
         
         6. Trademarks.
         
         This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,
         service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for
         reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
         reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
         
         7. Disclaimer of Warranty.
         
         Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the
         Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied,
         including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE,
         NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are
         solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or
         redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of
         permissions under this License.
         
         8. Limitation of Liability.
         
         In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence),
         contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
         and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental,
         or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or
         out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to
         damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or
         any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has
         been advised of the possibility of such damages.
         
         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.
         
         While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to
         offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or
         other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However,
         in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your
         sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You
         agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your
         accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
         
         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
         
         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work
         
         To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following boilerplate
         notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]" replaced with your own
         identifying information. (Don't include the brackets!) The text should be
         enclosed in the appropriate comment syntax for the file format. We also
         recommend that a file or class name and description of purpose be included on
         the same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier identification within
         third-party archives.
